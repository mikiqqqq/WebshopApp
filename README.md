State of Project: In progress

## SUMMARY:
This project is exactly what the title says it is, an online webshop application for techy devices. 

The main page displays all the offered products with the ability to sort, filter and search for desired items. While adding items to your shopping cart, you can increase or decrease the quantity. Also worth mentioning, the shopping cart summary will pop up on every first add after a new order is created.  

In the shopping cart, you can remove/add one or all the order items.  

The checkout page once again displays the order items in case you want to make changes and offers two forms which need to be filled out before proceeding. The subtotal, taxes, shipping, discount and the total price are calculated on every change. After proceeding with the checkout you are met with the message containing shipping info etc.

User Interface is intuitive and very simple, the user is met with all the necessary information. The webapp is responsive and it loads quickly. Feel free to explore all the other details.

## OVERVIEW:
* REST API built with Java Spring Boot
* UI built with the React Bootstrap library in Typescript
* SQL database using the H2 Database Engine

## POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
* Securing REST API with Mutual Certificates (or plain Login form)
* Responsivity for mobile devices
